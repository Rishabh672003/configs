# my_rate-mirror-configs
rate-mirrors is a arch linux program which ranks the mirrors, so that you can get fastest arch mirrors
this repo has my script and systemd service and timer which run it i.e. rate-mirrors every time you boot into your system
Note: I am just a begginer and this is my first time playing with systemd and its services
